# ✨ this project doesn't have a name yet ✨

also need to change the [domain name](https://supabase-game.vercel.app/)

also need to put a nice GIF here when I have a cute UI

Created with [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) and deployed
using [Vercel with T3](https://create.t3.gg/en/deployment/vercel).

`npm run dev` will start the server locally.  
`git push origin main` will deploy to Vercel.

### ⚙️ Infrastructure diagram

Might clean it up later

### 🎀 Frontend

Uses [Tailwind CSS with Next.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) and [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate
inputs.  
`./public` contains all the static files for the project, e.g. images.  
`./src/pages/` contains the website pages - each `.tsx` file becomes a route in the App.  
`./src/styles/` contains the CSS stylesheets.  
`./src/components/` should contain the React UI components.

### ⚙️ Backend

Uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).  
`./src/env.mjs` defines how to load the environment variables.
`./src/server/api/trpc.ts` initializes tRPC and lets you create routers and procedures.  
`./src/server/api/root.ts` imports and combines all the different routers into the main App route.  
`./src/server/api/db.ts` creates and exports the Prisma client so it can be used in the App.  
`./src/server/api/routers/` has files (routers) where you can define the functions that can be used for each router.

### 🗄️ Database

Uses [Prisma with Supabase](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/supabase).

`./prisma/schema.prisma` contains all the database schemas.  
`./prisma/seed.ts` contains the data to populate the tables with.

`npm run db` whenever I update database schema.  
`npx prisma studio` to edit data in a nice UI.   
`npx prisma db seed` to populate the tables with starter data
